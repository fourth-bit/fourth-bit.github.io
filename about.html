      Hi, my name is Ryan Wolk, and I am in the eighth grade at San Domenico. I have created this website for a Capstone project at school. All of the information aggregated into the site has been found by me alone to the best of my ability. There may be issues and errors, if so please tell me about it on <a class="text-info" href="https://github.com/fourth-bit/marin-donates/issues/">the github repository</a> or send me an email at <a class="text-info" href="mailto:ryanwolk@icloud.com">ryanwolk@icloud.com</a>.
    </p>

      Throughout COVID-19, we have been going through our belongings at a rate unseen before and discovering items we have no need for anymore. In Marin, the simple solution is to either discard it, or sell it on NextDoor. Here, the socioeconomic divide is large, and donating these items to a non-profit that benefits those in need would be a great change which the area could definitely use. This website is my solution to this issue. I hope that this can be used as a resource to find where you can donate your used items.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have developed this website by myself using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python. I used Python as a means of generating the webpages from a json file. For CSS I used the bootstrap library and its corresponding JavaScript libraries. CSS not included from this library is all done by me using the SASS preprocessor. I used JavaScript sparingly, only using it on the search page which takes functionality from the lunr.js search library and uses the jQuery library to interact with the HTML. All of the libraries I have mentioned are <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">open-source</a> and are licensed under the <a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/">MIT License</a>.

      If you have any feedback or you find an issue with this website, please open an issue on <a class="text-info" href="https://github.com/fourth-bit/marin-donates/issues/">the github repository</a> or send me an email at <a class="text-info" href="mailto:ryanwolk@icloud.com">ryanwolk@icloud.com</a>.
